Advancing in one's career can be a challenging and sometimes frustrating process. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of common barriers that individuals may encounter when seeking promotion and career advancement.

Lack of Clear Career Goals

One common barrier to career advancement is a lack of clear career goals. Individuals who are not sure what they want to achieve in their careers may struggle to identify opportunities for growth and advancement.

Limited Opportunities Within the Organization
